run backed tests: `npm run test`

run app: `run run dev`

### Summary ###

I wanted to build this app using good 'ol JS.  I wanted to avoid too much setup and boilerplate so I used Angular 1.  I like ES6, so just went with it assuming most browsers support it these days.

### Areas to Improve ###

The styling is atrocious, I know. :disappointed:

I also regret that this app does not have the following:

- accessibly.  it may be fine, but I didn't check
- validation in forms
- front-end tests
- handle api errors on front end
- html5 routing
- better organization of server files
- linting
- responsive css
